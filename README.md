# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

This application uses the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.

## Project Goals

- The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
- The user is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
- Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
- The user can enter an event when they click into a timeblock.
- When the user clicks the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage.
- When the user refreshes the page, the saved events persist.

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
